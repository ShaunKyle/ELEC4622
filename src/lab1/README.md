# Lab 1: Reading and writing images

The goal for this lab is to create a CLI tool that can read a `.bmp` image into 
memory, change pixel values in the image, then write the image out into a new 
`.bmp` file.

A secondary goal for the lab is to extend the tool to handle processing 
multiple images sequentially. This is to simulate the challenge of memory 
management when processing a video stream.

Overview

- Create a simple CLI
- Use a debugger
- Read and write `.bmp` files
